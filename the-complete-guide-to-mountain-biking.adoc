[quote, Mike Thompson, Professional Mountain Biker]
The key to good mountain biking is maintaining the right body position for the terrain.

# Example of elevation calculation
def calculate_elevation_gain(points):
    total_gain = 0
    for i in range(1, len(points)):
        if points[i] > points[i-1]:
            total_gain += points[i] - points[i-1]
    return total_gain

=== Braking Techniques

NOTE: Proper braking can make the difference between a successful ride and a crash.
